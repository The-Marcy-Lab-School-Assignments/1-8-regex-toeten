# Question
What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer
An example is when you're trying to make sure a string only includes alphanumeric characters. You would need to make an if/else statement to and type out every single alphanumeric character to see if its included in the string.
